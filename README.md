# autohot-key
This repository is for my auto hot-key scripts.

## How to?

Install Auto Hot-key script for your platform. Write your own scripts to automate simple tasks.

I made one simple script for deleting my Discord DMs without me manually doing anything. Writing these scripts is fairly simple. The only required logic is the order of keys you'd be pressing to complete a certain task and then specifying the sleep paramater.

I'll update this repo with new scripts as I use them but for now, it's just the Discord script.
